# Draw graphs of functions
 # Billy Pham

This program will draw (rather rough) graphs of functions. The function being graphed and the region of the graph to be displayed will be hardcoded into the program, but in such a way that the program can easily be modified and recompiled to graph different functions and display different sized regions of the graph
